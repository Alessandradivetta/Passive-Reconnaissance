# Passive-Reconnaissance
Learn about the essential tools for passive reconnaissance, such as whois, nslookup, and dig.

Reconnaissance (recon) can be defined as a preliminary survey to gather information about a target. We divide reconnaissance into:

Passive Reconnaissance

Active Reconnaissance

In passive reconnaissance, you rely on publicly available knowledge. It is the knowledge that you can access from publicly available resources without directly engaging with the target and it includes:
Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server.
Checking job ads related to the target website.
Reading news articles about the target company.

Active reconnaissance, on the other hand, requires direct engagement with the target.
Examples of active reconnaissance activities include:
Connecting to one of the company servers such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
Calling the company in an attempt to get information (social engineering).
Entering company premises pretending to be a repairman.

# WHOIS command
The whois command is used to obtain information about a domain, IP address, or autonomous. Here is how it works:

Basic usage:
You can run the command in the terminal like this:
```
whois example.com
```
In this way, you will obtain the domain name, registrant contact administrative contact technical contact name server creation date, expiration date.
# nslookup command
"Name Server Look Up" is a tool used to query DNS servers and obtain information about domains and IP addresses. Here is an overview of how it works:
```
nslookup example.com
```
The output provides information such as:
IP address associated with the domain; DNS server used for the query;  additional information about the DNS records, such as A, MX, TXT records, etc.

Also, nslookup is useful for diagnosing DNS resolution problems and obtaining information about a domain's DNS records.
You can specify a DNS server other than the default one, for example:
```
nslookup example.com 8.8.8.8
```
Letâ€™s say you want to learn about the email servers and configurations for a particular domain. You can issue nslookup -type=MX example.com.
